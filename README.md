More Brew packages are found [here](https://formulae.brew.sh/).

Linux version is coming, however Brew is supported in Linux, so feel free to use `installMacOSpackages.sh` on your Linux distro.

## How to use
``` 
./install.sh
```

## Other shell configurations
Config files including my zshrc, bashrc, vimrc, aliases etc. can be found in my [dotfile repository](https://github.com/sirimykland/dotfiles) for even faster setup on new computers.
